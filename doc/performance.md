Notes
-----

For "normal" use-cases, the performance of the AT-interface is comparable
to the native interface. The sections below show some examples for
comparing a Pico+ESP32C3 with a Pico-W.

The first example queries the OpenMeteo weather service every minute.
The last three columns show the time necessary to send the request,
to process the response and the amount of free memory (without any
manual garbage collection). The "send-time" also includes the time
necessary to connect to the service and this is the dominant figure.

The second example is a server use-case. The requested page links to
a number of js script-files and css-files. Since browsers open many
parallel connections to the server, this example only works well with
a firmware version that supports more than five parallel connections.

Even in this scenario the performance of the AT-interface is on par
with the native performance.

One example where the native interface is much faster is when sending
UDP packets. The use-case is a high-frequency data-sampling application
that sends the data via UDP to a server (or second device). The Pico-W
can send about 1000 packets per second, whereas the AT-interface reaches
only about 100 packets per second.
